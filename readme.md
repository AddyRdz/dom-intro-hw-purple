# JS DOM Practice

## Instructions

1. Fork and clone this repository.
1. Change into the new directory.

## JS DOM Practice - Deliverable

This evening's deliverable will ask you to practice getting elements from the DOM using the common methods for interacting
with the DOM!

Requirements: 
Complete all of the requirements in the `dom_content.js`, `getelements.js` and `querySelector.js` files. 

Test your code and leave your answers commented out. 

For testing each of these prompts you should store the result in a variable and `console.log` it see if you got it right.

If you are stuck, refer back to the [lesson notes](https://git.generalassemb.ly/seir-1213-staging/js-dom)

Complete this deliverable in the following order: 

## 1. `getElement(s)By`

The first set of DOM getters we'll talk about are the `getElement(s)By` methods,
like `getElementById`. Open up `getelements.js` and work through the prompts.

## 2. `querySelector`

The second set of DOM getters we'll talk about are `querySelector` and
`querySelectorAll`. Comment out `getelements.js` in `index.html` and uncomment
`queryselector.js`. Then open up `queryselector.js` and work through the
prompts.

## 3. Updating DOM Content

Use the following methods of DOM nodes to update the content of the DOM:

* `innerHTML`
* `outerHTML`
* `innerText`
* `outerText`
* `textContent`

# Choose your own adventure

To extend your learning and practice reading documentation, choose one of the prompts in the '/choose-your-own-adventure' folder.
Work on __ONE__ of the prompts in either #4 (medium) __OR__ #5 (medium-hard)

## 4. Working with the `classList` API

The following are the three methods we can use to work with classes on a DOM
node:

1. `.classList.add()`
1. `.classList.remove()`
1. `.classList.toggle()`

## 5. Working with `data-*` Attributes

Use the `data-*` attribute to add data to a DOM node. You can get that data in
JavaScript with a node's `dataset` property.
